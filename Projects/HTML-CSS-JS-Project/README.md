# HTML-CSS-JS-Project

## Overview

In this project, `Validate()`, is designed for form validation. It helps ensure that user inputs meet specific criteria before submitting a form. By integrating this function into your web forms, you can enhance the user experience by providing real-time feedback and preventing invalid submissions.

## How It Works

### Validating First Name and Last Name
The script checks if the first and last names are empty and if they contain only letters. It displays appropriate alerts if the criteria are not met.

### Validating Contact and Other Details
The function validates the contact number, ensuring it contains only numbers and has a length of 10 digits & other details like date and gender.
