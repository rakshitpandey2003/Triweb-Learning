# TypeScript Exploration

Welcome to the TypeScript directory! In this directory, I've delved into TypeScript and its application in web development, focusing on converting Express code to TypeScript syntax and exploring router/controller/module concepts. You'll find examples and exercises that cover essential concepts for working with TypeScript in Express.js projects.

## Converting Express Code to TypeScript

- **Description:** Explore the process of converting Express.js code to TypeScript, enhancing type safety and maintainability.
- **Files:** TypeScript versions of Express code.

## Router, Controller, and Module Concepts

- **Description:** Dive into the router, controller, and module patterns in Express.js, learning how to structure and organize your web applications.
- **Files:** TypeScript files illustrating router, controller, and module concepts.

Feel free to use these TypeScript examples as reference material while working on your own web development projects that involve TypeScript and Express.js.

Enjoy your journey of exploring TypeScript in web development!
