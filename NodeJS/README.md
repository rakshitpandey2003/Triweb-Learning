# NodeJS Practice

Welcome to the NodeJS Practice directory! In this directory, I've honed my Node.js skills by working on projects that involve creating routes, handling requests, connecting to databases, and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Additionally, I've utilized [Postman]((https://www.postman.com/downloads/)), a popular collaboration platform for API development, to streamline the process of building, testing, and documenting APIs.
