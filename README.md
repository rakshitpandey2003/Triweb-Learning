## Guiding Through Git and Beyond

Here's a map to navigate the terrain of Git repository setup, cloning, editing, and pushing your creations:

```bash
# Forge a repository adorned with a foundational README on the GitHub horizon.
git clone <https://github.com/rakshitpandey2003/Triweb-Learning> # Embark on your coding odyssey by cloning this repository to your local abode.
# Reveal your code's canvas within the sacred halls of Visual Studio Code.
git add <file>
git add .
# Imprint your creative essence into the annals of code by committing changes.
git commit -m "<message>"
git push origin <branch>
```
