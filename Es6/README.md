# ES6 JavaScript Practice

Welcome to the ES6 directory! Here, you'll find JavaScript code examples that focus on practicing commonly used features and improvements introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).

## About

In this directory, I've explored and practiced various features of ES6, allowing me to write more modern and efficient JavaScript code. These examples are designed to help me gain a deeper understanding of ES6 concepts.

## ES6 JavaScript Examples

### 1. `math.js`

**Description:**  
The `math.js` file contains examples that explore some of the new math methods introduced in ES6. These methods enhance the mathematical capabilities of JavaScript.

### 2. `spread.js`

**Description:**  
The `spread.js` file demonstrates the use of the spread operator (`...`) in ES6. It showcases how the spread operator can simplify array and object manipulation and copying.

### 3. `propertyShorthand.js`

**Description:**  
`propertyShorthand.js` exemplifies the shorthand syntax for objects introduced in ES6. It illustrates how this syntax can make object creation and manipulation more concise and readable.

## How to Use

1. Study the code examples in each file to gain insights into the specific ES6 features being demonstrated.

2. Experiment with the code by making modifications and running it in a JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js or a web browser console).

3. Feel free to use these examples as reference material while working on your own JavaScript projects or when you encounter similar ES6 features in other codebases.

4. If you have questions or want to learn more about ES6 JavaScript, there are plenty of online resources and documentation available to deepen your understanding.

Happy coding and enjoy exploring ES6 features!
